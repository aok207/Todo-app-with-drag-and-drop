## My process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind
- Typescript
- CSS custom properties
- Vite
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I haven't touch on drag and drop functionality yet, so this was the perfect opportunity to learn how to do it. And not gonna like, it was a little bit challenging but worth it.

### Useful resources

- [Drap And Drop Tuto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyGqKt86gU0) - This video helped me with the drap and drop funcitonality.
- [Dark mode tailwind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxIBnvb8B7Y) - I recommedn this video for adding dark mode with tailwind.
